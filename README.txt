The program runs by executing 'python server.py' and 'python client.py' 
The file predefined in the program is "100worst.txt"
When the server starts, it will ask for an artist name
it will then respond with the songs associated to that artist;
otherwise if the artist is not found, it will say 'no artists associated..'
if an empty string is input, the program will keep asking for an artist name
the program will keep asking for an artist name, unless the user types in 'quit',
in which case it will end the connection and exit
there should be no problems when running the program on windows and university
machines
